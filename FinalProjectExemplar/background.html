        <p id="call">The FluTats team is committed to redefining the way we fight the flu through technology innovation and product quality and design. In doing so, our work hopes to dramatically decrease the number of children lost to the flu. We regularly engage with the CDC, donors, and individual consumers to better understand the problem and become an active part of the solution.</p>
